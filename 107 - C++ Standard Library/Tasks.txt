Task 1
 
Write a program that prompts the user to enter a complex impedance. 

They should enter values for the real and imaginary parts.
Then ask then to enter a value for the voltage in polar form (hint: consult the complex class documentation online).
You should then be able to work out the (complex) current and display its absolute value and phase angle.

Task 2
 
Write a programs that takes in a binary value from the user and outputs the decimal value.

(Hint: a bitset has a fixed-width, so you will need to check how many bits the user has entered (think string size) and then prompt them if they have entered too many).


Task 3

File MOCK_DATA.csv (1.066 KB)
Using the MOCK_DATA.csv file which contains names and scores, write a program that reads the data into a map (string, int). Look back at the CSV code from a previous lab for inspiration.
Once the data is in a map, ask the user to enter a name. Look for the name in the map and print the score (if it exists).

Task 4
 
Create a vector of ints. Add some values to it.
Iterate through the array and remove any odd numbers.
Print to the terminal to check it has worked as expected.
