        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The C++ Standard Library is a set of classes that comes as a part of the C++ language. These classes include things such as strings and arrays as well as common mathematical functions. They can be used in programs through including the relevant header file e.g. <code>string</code> and are usually declared within the <code>std</code> namespace.</p>
        <p>You have already come across several of these classes in previous laboratory sessions and in this session, we will look at some others that can be useful.</p>
        <p>You will also be expected to start looking online for resources in order to help you learn how to use these classes. You are not expected know the entire C++ language off the top of your head (I certainly do not!). I doubt many people in the whole world know how to use every single feature of the language. A big part of being a programmer is having the ability to search online in order to find APIs (application programming interfaces) and example code and being able to adapt them to your own needs.</p>
        <p>A good starting point is usually <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/">cplusplus.com</a>. It contains a list of all C++ library, along with a full API and example code.</p>
