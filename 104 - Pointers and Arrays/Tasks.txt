Task 1
 
Obtain the task template code from the required files.
Create two dynamic arrays y and t. You should use a variable n to set the length of these arrays. Initially use a value of 20. These arrays will be used to store the values of time and a mathematical function y.

Task 2
 
Create a new double variable f to set the frequency of the function (e.g. 100 Hz). Use f to calculate the period T. Then use n to calculate the time-step dt.
Using a for loop, fill the t array with the correct values. For example, a function with a period of 1.0 s and 5 values would have values of 0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and 1.0
Using the math library 'cmath', fill the y array with the values
sin(ωt)
in which ω is equal to 2πf

Task 3
 
After you have filled in the arrays, use a for loop to print them to screen in comma-separated variable (csv) format t,y e.g.
0.0,0.0
0.2, 0.34

When you run your .exe file, pipe the output to a text file e.g.
main.exe > output.txt

Import your text file into Excel or another suitable program and plot the graph to see if you are correct.

Task 4
 
Extend the 'passing arrays' example code by adding a function to calculate the mean (average) value of an array.
