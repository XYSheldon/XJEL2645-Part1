Task 1
 
Follow through the simple sum example. Compile the code and run in GDB. Practice setting watchpoints and breakpoints and inspecting variables.

Task 2
 
Run the Fibonacci example in GDB. Again, practice setting watchpoints and breakpoints and step through the code with the de-bugger.
Display 'fn', 'fn_minus1' and 'fn_minus2' so you can see their values each time the code halts.

Task 3
 
Write some code that loops through the numbers 2 to n and prints out whether the number is prime or not.
A prime number is one that is only divisible by 1 and itself. 
You will need 2 loops.
One loop is to loop through the numbers 2 to n
There should be an inner loop that loops from 1 up to the number itself and checks whether the number is divisible
Hint: a number is divisible if you divide it by a number and there is no remainder (%)
The output should be something like:
2 is prime
3 is prime
4 is not prime
5 is prime
6 is not prime
7 is prime
8 is not prime
9 is not prime
10 is not prime
11 is prime
...
Use the de-bugging techniques covered in the lab to help you de-bug the inevitable mistakes that you make.
Try to make use of GDB
YOU ARE NOT PERMITTED TO GET ANY HELP DEVELOPING THIS CODE! THE WHOLE POINT IS FOR YOU TO GET BETTER AT DE-BUGGING AND FINDING YOUR OWN MISTAKES!
